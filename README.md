# Applied Data Science Projects Documentation.

# Summary
The project involved using Python programming language and some built-in libraries
to plot and analyse data. There were two imported built-in libraries, and one imported custom
module used in the entirety of the assignment. The two imported built-in libraries are Matplotlib
and Pandas while the imported custom module is called color_module.
Matplotlib built-in module called pyplot contains a lot of function, which was used for
creating plots while Pandas was used to read and manipulate datasets. The colour_module
contains a function, that returns a list of colors used for the bar plot.
Three kinds of plot were drawn for the assignment. Each plot uses a different dataset
from the other. Plots drawn includes, a bar plot, a line plot and a pie plot.
The visualization of the datasets, explanation of the plots will be shown and discussed in
the next few lines.

# A bar plot displaying the frequency of apps in each category of the google play store
![frequency of the categories of app](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59482569/222875225-f28999f9-492d-44f9-a9fa-5a07d5ef1cda.jpg)
# Why Bar Plot
Bar plots are good for analysing categorical type of data. It is excellent for displaying data with discrete categories. Bar plot was chosen for this plot because, the dataset contains a list of categories of apps in the Google playstore. This list of categories in the Google playstore fits in properly into creating a bar plot.

# Bar Plot Description
The bar plot shows that of the top 20 categories of app in the Google playstore, there are more family apps than any other apps. Explicitly, the bar plot shows that there are 1972 family apps. This 1972 family apps, takes 20.48% of the top 20 categories in the Google playstore. There are 295 Social apps. This takes 3.06% of the top 20 categories of apps in the Google playstore.

Each line of this plot denotes a trend for the total number of women in the USA House of Representative, number of women in the Republican party and number of women in the democratic party from the year 1975 to 2019. As the year increases from 1975, the plot shows that there is an increase in the total number of women in the USA House of Representative. From the year 1991, the plot shows that there is an enormous increase the total number of women in the USA House of Representative.

Furthermore, the plot shows that there are more women in the Democratic party compared to the Republican party as the year increases. The Republican party never had more women than the Democratic party. From the year 2013 to 2019 the Democratic party had consistency in the
number of women in the house of representative.
